## Short Bio

I am a second-year M.S. student at [SIGMA Group](http://sigma.whu.edu.cn/) in the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Yong Luo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=zb1oVGIAAAAJ) and [Prof. Bo Du](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Shy1gnMAAAAJ). I focus on AI for Protein, and Machine Learning. Before that, I reveived my B.S. degree from the [Software College](http://sc.neu.edu.cn/english/main.htm), [Northeastern University (NEU)](https://english.neu.edu.cn/), where I was supervised by [Prof. Zhuofu Deng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=wd_bmu0AAAAJ).

I am passionate about the AI applications in scientific research, particularly in the protein field, and I am also interested in machine learning theory. My guiding principle in research is to engage in meaningful (有意义的) and joyful (有意思的) scientific work.

Feel free to reach me out. (recommended via email)
