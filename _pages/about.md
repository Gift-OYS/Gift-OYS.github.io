## Short Bio

I am a second-year M.S. student at [SIGMA Group](http://sigma.whu.edu.cn/) in the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Yong Luo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=zb1oVGIAAAAJ) and [Prof. Bo Du](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Shy1gnMAAAAJ). Before that, I reveived my B.S. degree from the [Software College](http://sc.neu.edu.cn/english/main.htm), [Northeastern University (NEU)](https://english.neu.edu.cn/), where I was supervised by [Prof. Zhuofu Deng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=wd_bmu0AAAAJ).

I am passionate about the AI applications in scientific research, particularly in the protein field, and I am also interested in machine learning theory. My guiding principle in research is to engage in meaningful (有意义的) and joyful (有意思的) scientific work.

<font color=red>I am looking for research collaborator or Research Scientist/Engineer in job market. Feel free to contact me if you have any openings! (recommended via email)</font>
